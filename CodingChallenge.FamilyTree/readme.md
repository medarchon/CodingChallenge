Context

	- You are given a family tree.  
	- This family tree is made up of people, each with a list of decendants.   
	- Each descendant is unique (we're only tracking one side of the family), and names are not repeated.
	
Given the following family

					Ted
					 /\
					/  \
				  Jim  Sally
				  /      /\
				 /      /  \
			   Bob    Joe  George

Write a method that, given the person Ted and the string 'Joe' are passed in, will return Joe's birth month.
Once that is complete, augment the method to handle Names that do not exist in the family tree.

Feel free to add/remove anything from this Solution that will help you in solving the problem.  Comments are appreciated to explain thought process.
